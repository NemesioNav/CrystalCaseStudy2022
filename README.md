Crystal Data Science Course Case Study: Car sales prediction with supervised machine learning algorithms

Case study
1. Analyze variables, fill in missing values, normalize extreme values.
2. Visualize the important variables and test the relationship between the variables.
3. Build a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether a vehicle will be sold or not. (Or you can use a regression model to predict the number of days a vehicle will stay on the site until sold)
